PostgreSQL account containing database: mag2272

URL: http://40.114.5.177:8111/

Description:
	Our web application implements the following features:
		* Dashboard for Residents
			* Interface to register guests
			* Interface to request parked cars that they are allowed to drive
			* Interface to to view the third-party services available to the resident
		* Dashboard for Building Administrators
			* Interface to look up and check entrants
				* Ability to add a drivable car to a found entrant, so that the entrant can request the car from their dashboard if they are a resident.
			* Interface to view the currently requested cars
				* Ability to mark car as "unparked" which sets it as no longer requested and removes parking information from it so it is effectively no longer parked in the building
			* Interface to look up a car by state & license plate and park it or modify its information
				* If the lookup doesn't find the car in the database, an interface to add a new car is shown
		* Dashboard for Business Owners
			* Interface to modify the description and contact information for a business, as well as to choose which buildings are served by the business.

	This application fully implements the specification we laid out in Part 1. 

	The only major features that are missing are the ability to add or remove buildings, add or remove residents and service employees from a building, and the ability to create a new business. This is because this was not in our specification, and is not really necessary if the database is pre-populated with data. We pre-populated the database with a slightly modified version of the sample data from Part 2, thus the application is still able to interact with the database in very interesting ways.
